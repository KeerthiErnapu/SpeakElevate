            <h3>1. Present Tense:</h3>
            <p>Indicates actions happening right now or regularly. Example: <em>I play football every day.</em></p>
            <h3>2. Past Tense:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions that have already happened. Example: <em>I played football yesterday.</em></p>
            <h3>3. Future Tense:</h3>
            <p>Indicates actions that will happen. Example: <em>I will play football tomorrow.</em></p>
            <h3>4. Present Continuous:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions happening now. Example: <em>I am playing football right now.</em></p>
            <h3>5. Past Continuous:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions that were happening at a specific point in the past. Example: <em>I was playing football when you called me.</em></p>
            <h3>6. Future Continuous:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions that will be happening at a specific point in the future. Example: <em>I will be playing football at 5 PM tomorrow.</em></p>
            <h3>7. Present Perfect:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions that have happened at an unspecified time. Example: <em>I have played football before.</em></p>
            <h3>8. Past Perfect:</h3>
            <p>Describes actions that were completed before another event in the past. Example: <em>I had played football before it started raining.</em></p>
            <h3>9. Future Perfect:</h3>

            <p><strong>The</strong> is used to refer to something specific. Example: <em>The book on the table is mine.</em></p>
            <h3>2. Indefinite Articles:</h3>
            <p><strong>A</strong> and <strong>An</strong> are used to refer to non-specific things. Example: <em>A dog is barking outside. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.</em></p>
